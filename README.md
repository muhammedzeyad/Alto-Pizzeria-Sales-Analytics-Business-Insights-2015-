# **Alto Pizzeria Sales Analytics & Business Insights (2015)**


## Background and Overview

Established in late 2013, Alto Pizzeria has become a well-known establishment in the local community, serving a diverse range of pizzas to a loyal customer base. Through its online ordering system and in-store sales, the company has gathered extensive data on customer preferences, sales performance, and product demand.

This report systematically analyzes the transaction data to extract key insights that will optimize menu offerings and enhance day-to-day operational efficiency. The data preparation, cleaning, and visualization for this analysis were conducted entirely in Excel. By analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), we offer recommendations to drive sustained business growth and profitability.

The Excel dashboard is available in the file **alto_pizzeria_final.xlsx** in the GitHub repository.

A view-only interactive version of the dashboard can be accessed [here](https://onedrive.live.com/personal/8a36db2073f9f154/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3665d4ec-70fc-4e6b-8347-61609743d098%7D&action=default).

The GitHub repository contains the unprocessed Excel file (**alto_pizzeria_sales.xlsx**) and the transformed dataset with pivot tables and the dashboard (**alto_pizzeria_final.xlsx**).


## Objectives

The main objectives of this report are:

1. **Analyze Daily and Hourly Sales Performance**: Evaluate sales trends across different times of the day and across different days of the week, identifying peak sales periods and fluctuations in demand.
2. **Identify Top and Worst Pizza Categories and Sizes**: Determine the best-selling and worst-selling pizza categories and sizes.
3. **Provide Business Recommendations**: Give actionable steps to optimise staffing, inventory, promotional efforts, menu refinement, and ingredient procurement based on the insights drawn from the analysis.



## Executive Summary

The pizzeria's sales data reveals sales consistently peak during lunch (12 PM - 1 PM) and dinner (4 PM - 7 PM), with office workers, students, and families driving demand during these hours. Sales tend to dip between 2 PM and 4 PM, and gradually decline after 7 PM as dining activity slows. Fridays and Saturdays generate the highest revenue, particularly Friday nights, reflecting increased social gatherings and weekend relaxation. In contrast, Sundays and Mondays experience the lowest sales volumes due to reduced social dining.

Regarding product performance, classic pizzas dominate both sales and revenue, although all pizza categories perform relatively well, indicating a diverse customer base with varied preferences. The Classic Deluxe Pizza leads in sales, closely followed by the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, while the Brie Carre Pizza and Mediterranean Pizza are the least popular. Large-sized pizzas contribute the highest share of revenue (45.89%), followed by medium and small sizes at 30.49% and 21.77%, respectively. Extra-large and XX-large pizzas have minimal impact on overall revenue, accounting for only 1.72% and 0.12% of total sales.



## Comprehensive Analysis and Findings

### **Daily and Hourly Sales Performance Analysis**

- **Sales consistently peak between 12 PM and 1 PM and between 4 PM and 7 PM**, making lunch and dinner-time the most profitable periods. The midday peak aligns with traditional lunch breaks for office workers and students, while the evening peak is driven by families and social gatherings. Sales exhibit a dip between 2 PM and 4 PM, when fewer people dine out, and undergo a steady decline after 7 PM as customers complete their evening meals and transition to other activities. **All in all, this means that approximately 65% of daily sales occur between these hourly periods**.

- **Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays** generate the highest revenue, with Friday nights showing the highest demand. This pattern is largely influenced by social dining habits, relaxation, and increased group outings on the weekend. On the other hand, Sundays and Mondays record the lowest sales volume, likely due to fewer social gatherings and the tendency for customers to stay home. **It is worth noting that Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays generate around 50% of total sales**.

### **Pizza Category and Size Performance**

- **Classic pizzas dominate sales and revenue, making up the highest proportion in both metrics**. That being said, all pizza categories are very close in terms of distribution,  indicating diverse customer preferences and strong-performing pizzas within each category.

## Business Recommendations

- **During peak sales hours** (12 PM - 1 PM and 4 PM - 7 PM) and **on high-traffic days** (Friday and Saturday), optimise staffing levels and ingredient management to ensure smooth operations and maximize order fulfilment. Additionally, leverage these peak periods by offering bundled/combo meal deals and promotions to increase sales, drive larger orders, introduce customers to premium or new menu items, strengthen customer loyalty, and encourage repeat business.
- During low-sales hours and low-traffic days, implement weekday promotions like “Monday Madness” or “Sunday Specials” to **attract customers and boost demand during slower periods.**
- Consider dropping the XXL pizzas, as they generate only **0.12% of total revenue**, making them an insignificant contributor to overall sales and revenue. Keeping this size incurs unnecessary storage and ingredient costs that could be better allocated to more profitable options like **large and medium pizzas**, which together account for over **76% of revenue**. However, before making this decision, assess whether XXL pizzas serve a niche market, attract loyal repeat customers, or play a role in bundle deals that drive additional sales.
- Given that top-selling pizzas like the Classic Deluxe Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza are already doing quite well in terms of sales, **consider increasing the visibility of top-selling products through promotions or combo deals, and featured spots on menus or online advertising** to increase their total number of sales.
- Since the Brie Carre Pizza and Mediterranean Pizza are doing poorly, consider either **removing them from the menu and reallocating resources** to revenue-generating items or **revamping** their recipes, ingredients, or marketing to make them more appealing.
- Since the Classic Deluxe Pizza and Barbecue Chicken Pizza are highly popular, **consider creating variations** **on well-performing pizzas**, such as a spicy version, a stuffed-crust option, or a premium ingredient upgrade, to leverage existing demand and find new winning products.
- **Train upselling techniques to staff** to prompt customers to enhance their orders with additional toppings, premium crust options, or side dishes when purchasing pizzas. This will serve to maximise average order value (AOV) on regular days and maximize revenue during peak hours and high-traffic periods. Given that our AOV is $38.31, and if we assume that our new upselling initiative adds $3–$5 per order, the AOV would increase to $41.31-$43.31. This means that **by implementing upsells, AOV is estimated to increase by 7%-13%**.
